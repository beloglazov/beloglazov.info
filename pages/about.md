Thanks for visiting my web site :) My name is Anton Beloglazov, I'm a Russian
originally from [Novosibirsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk).
Currently, I live in Melbourne, Australia, and really enjoy this warm and
friendly country. I'm a software engineer and researcher, passionate about
functional programming, distributed systems, and Computer Science in general.

I've recently completed my [PhD](/thesis.pdf) and at the moment work at IBM
Research focusing on bushfire evacuation modelling and fire simulation. If you
are interested in further details about my work, please have a look at my
[CV](/beloglazov_cv.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to [open
source](https://github.com/beloglazov), polishing my [Arch
Linux](https://github.com/beloglazov/arch-config),
[Xmonad](https://github.com/beloglazov/xmonad-config), [Fish
shell](https://github.com/beloglazov/fish-config), and
[Vim](https://github.com/beloglazov/vimrc) configs, and learning Haskell and
Scalaz. By the way, this web site is powered by the awesome
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static web site generator written in
Haskell by [Jasper Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be/).
