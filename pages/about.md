Thanks for visiting my web site :) My name is Anton Beloglazov, I'm a Russian
originally from [Novosibirsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk).
Currently, I live in Mountain View, USA, where I work for Google. I'm a software
engineer and researcher, passionate about functional programming, distributed
systems, and Computer Science in general -- check out my [PhD
thesis](/thesis.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to [open
source](https://github.com/beloglazov) and learning Haskell. By the way, this
web site is powered by the awesome [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static
web site generator written in Haskell by [Jasper Van der
Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be/).
